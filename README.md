## Project Description

**Bitcoin Wallet Fetcher** (_BWF_) is designed to retrieve large datasets of Bitcoin wallet addresses from specified online sources (Blockchair). **It automates downloading, decompressing, and categorizing these addresses into meaningful groupings such as balances, prefix types, and subsets for quick reference or downstream processing.**

## What is Bitcoin Wallet Fetcher?

Bitcoin Wallet Fetcher is a Python script that :

1. Automates file downloads from websites using `Selenium`.
2. Decompresses `.gz` files to extract datasets.
3. Processes Bitcoin wallet addresses and organizes them based on prefixes (`1`, `3`, or `bc1`) and `balance` criteria.
4. Outputs the processed data into structured text files for easier consumption.

## Features

- **Automated File Handling** : Automatically fetch and decompress files.
- **Categorization** : Splits wallet data into categories based on prefix types and balance ranges.
- **Scheduling** : Includes a daily scheduled task to run the entire pipeline at a specified time.
- **Logging** : Provides detailed logs for every step of the process.
